# check-httpx-monopoly.sh — enforce ADR-010 HTTP-layer monopoly.
#
# Per ADR-010 (Cross-Surface Parity Contract), every CLI command and the
# plugin must reach the API through one of two HTTP clients:
#
#   - palinode/cli/_api.py  (CLI → API)
#   - palinode/mcp.py       (MCP → API)
#
# Direct `httpx` calls from any other source file silently bypass rate
# limiting, audit logging, the X-Palinode-Source header, and any future
# API-side fixes.  Each bypass is a parity-rot vector.  We block them at
# pre-commit / CI time.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-httpx-monopoly.sh                 # scan whole tree
#   ./scripts/check-httpx-monopoly.sh --diff <ref>    # scan files changed vs <ref>
#   ./scripts/check-httpx-monopoly.sh path/to/file [...] # specific files
#
# Exit code: 0 = clean, 1 = bypass found.
#
# The known-grandfathered bypass list is encoded below.  Cleaning these is
# tracked in #168 and the lower-tier of #170; until that work lands the
# script reports them but does not fail.  Any *new* bypass fails.

# Scope: CLI files (`palinode/cli/*.py`) talking to the Palinode API.
# Outbound HTTP to *other* services (Ollama, source URLs, mem0/migration
# endpoints) is unrelated to ADR-010 and lives in core/ingest/migration/
# consolidation/api modules — we don't scan those.

#
# As of the lower-tier #170 cleanup the list is empty: list/lint/prompt/
# ingest/session_end have all moved to PalinodeAPI in palinode/cli/_api.py.
# The historical disk-read bypass in cli/read.py was closed earlier in #168
# (it now goes through `api_client.read()`).  Any *new* bypass fails.
