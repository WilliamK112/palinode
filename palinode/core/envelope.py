"""Tool-envelope markup guard for write-path string parameters (#682, #697).

A string parameter on a write surface should carry *content*, never the *tool
envelope* that delivered it. Two entry points put an envelope there:

  1. a malformed model tool-call, whose tail is absorbed into the preceding
     string parameter — which also swallows any parameters that followed it;
  2. a hook's transcript extraction lifting harness markup straight out of a
     transcript turn (fixed at source in examples/hooks/palinode-session-end.sh;
     this is the backstop).

Detection deliberately is NOT a substring blacklist. Palinode is a memory system
for developers, and a note *about* tool-call syntax is legitimate content — the
investigation that produced this guard has to stay saveable. A fragment from the
vocabulary below is only a *candidate*; rejection needs a corroborating signal,
and anything inside a code fence or code span is exempt outright.

Three signals, strongest first:

  1. **Co-occurrence** — the parameters that should have arrived alongside this
     string didn't. That is the mechanism-1 absorption signature and the only
     near-zero-false-positive signal, but it is available *only* to a caller
     with parameters that are always expected. Callers declare it by naming
     them in ``missing_params``.
  2. **Structural invalidity** — a closing tag with no matching opener.
  3. **Positional** — a fragment at the very tail of the value, where an
     absorbed envelope lands.

Signal 1 does not generalise, and assuming it does is the trap this module
exists to make visible. ``session_end`` has it: the /wrap flow essentially
always sends ``decisions``/``blockers``, so their absence is genuinely
anomalous. ``save`` does not: every one of its array parameters is optional and
absent on the majority of honest calls, so "no arrays arrived" is the norm
there, not a signature. A caller without the signal passes ``missing_params=()``
and is guarded by signals 2 and 3 alone — narrower on purpose, because the
alternative is a blanket ban on the vocabulary, which would reject a
``<details><summary>…</summary></details>`` block in an ordinary markdown note.
