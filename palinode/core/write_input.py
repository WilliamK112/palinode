"""One normalise seam below every write surface.

Before this module, "a surface received input" and "the capability runs" were
separated by nothing, so input handling was per-param, per-surface and
per-author. Two symptoms:

* ``_coerce_str_array`` — the JSON-string-array tolerance MCP clients need —
  existed exactly once, in ``mcp.py``, applied at ten sites all inside
  ``mcp.py``. CLI, API and plugin had no equivalent.
* The four surfaces disagreed about what an *empty* value means. ``cli/_api.py``
  elided an empty ``contradicts`` (``if contradicts:``) while ``mcp.py``
  forwarded it (``is not None``), so ``contradicts: []`` meant "no conflicts,
  asserted" over MCP and "never specified" over CLI.

That second bug had already been found and fixed once, on one param, on one
surface — ``cli/_api.py``'s ``session_end`` carries the post-mortem for
``decisions``/``blockers``: *"An empty list means 'considered, none to report';
eliding it makes the server read a parameter the caller did send as one that
never arrived."* The lesson was never propagated to ``save``. Re-deriving the
same fix per-param, per-surface is what a missing seam looks like from outside.

So the rule lives here, once, declaratively:

**Include a parameter when it is not None.** An empty list or dict is a
deliberate assertion and is forwarded. The sole exception is a parameter marked
``omit_if_empty`` — the free-text strings where ``""`` carries no meaning the
server could act on (``title``, ``slug``, ``source``, ``project``); those elide
when blank, which is what every surface already did for them.

Surfaces call :func:`build_payload` with whatever they received and get back the
canonical parameter set. The plugin (``plugin/index.ts``) is deliberately not a
consumer: it is already a bare ``JSON.stringify(params)`` pass-through, which is
the correct shape — it was the *thinnest* adapter and the most correct one.

    Some MCP transports/clients serialize array arguments as JSON strings
    (e.g. ``'["a","b"]'``) instead of native arrays. FastAPI's Pydantic
    validation rejects those with "expected array, received string". This
    helper decodes the string form when it's clearly a JSON array; otherwise
    it returns ``value`` unchanged so native lists pass through.

    Despite the name, element types are never inspected — any decoded JSON list
    is returned as-is. That is why it applies equally to arrays of objects
    (``sources``, ``claims``) and arrays of strings (``entities``,
    ``contradicts``, ``backed_by``). Applied to EVERY array parameter on a
    write-path tool: guarding only some produced a partial experience where one
    array silently worked and the rest failed in three different shapes, which
    is harder to diagnose than uniform failure.
