"""Source-quote integrity verification (provenance Q2, the quote-hash source-anchor work).

The deterministic, offline, network-free core of the quote-drift check requested in
public issue the OpenClaw-profile migration plan (Q2): given a claim that cites a quote
from a source, confirm the quote (a) is internally consistent with its recorded hash and
(b) still appears in the cited source. This is the analog of yopedia's Phase C
anchor-verifier lint.

Scope boundary: this module is the *primitive* only — pure verification logic plus a
thin file reader over the proposed ``sources:`` anchor shape. It does NOT define the
capture path or commit the live frontmatter schema (that needs sign-off; see the
quote-hash source-anchor work). It is intentionally a plain integrity check — verifying
that a cited quote still matches its source involves no cryptographic signing or
attestation, so it has no dependency on the separate memory-attestation work.

Proposed anchor shape (per the quote-hash source-anchor work, not yet a captured schema)::

    sources:
      - ref: research/some-paper.md # path under memory_dir
        quote: "the exact cited passage"
        quote_hash: "sha256:<hex of normalize_quote(quote)>"
