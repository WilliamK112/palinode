"""The README must not name a CLI command that does not exist.

Documentation and implementation for the ``dream`` alias arrive from two
different places — the alias from a contributor PR on the public repo, the
positioning paragraph from here — so the ordering between them is a thing a
human has to remember, right up until it is a thing CI enforces.

This is the same shape as the ``server.json`` <-> ``mcp.py`` metadata pin: two
artifacts that must agree, bound by a test rather than by discipline. A README
that documents a command the CLI does not have is the same defect class the
repo keeps finding elsewhere — a surface confidently describing behaviour that
is not there.

Scoped deliberately narrowly. This checks commands the README presents as
runnable ``palinode <verb>`` invocations in prose, not every string in every
table, because a table of planned or third-party commands is a different thing
from a sentence telling a reader what to type.
