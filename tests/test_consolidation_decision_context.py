"""The compaction prompt must carry the decisions governing the project.

``_get_decisions_for_project`` existed since the original runner and was never
called — one occurrence in the whole package, the ``def`` itself. So
``_consolidate_project`` proposed operations against a project's status doc with
no knowledge of that project's decisions, and could propose an UPDATE or
SUPERSEDE contradicting a live decision with nothing to notice: the executor
validates operation *shape*, not agreement with the decision record.

Decisions are supplied as **constraints**, not as material to compact. They are
not in EXISTING_FACTS and no operation targets them, which is why these tests
assert on what reaches the prompt rather than on what the executor writes.
