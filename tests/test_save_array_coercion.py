"""the array-param coercion fix: every array parameter on palinode_save tolerates a
double-encoded array.

Some MCP clients serialize array arguments as JSON strings. `_coerce_str_array`
was written against that observed behaviour but wired to only ONE of save's five
array params, so the same client input made `entities` work and the other four
fail — in three different error shapes, from three hand-rolled code paths.

Partial tolerance is the worst of both worlds: the caller sees some arrays land
and concludes the transport is fine.
