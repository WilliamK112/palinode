"""The MCP dispatcher's failure prefixes must cover every failure it emits.

The dispatcher reports failure *in-band*: a normal ``TextContent`` whose text
starts with a known prefix. Nothing in the type system distinguishes
``"Save failed: connection refused"`` from a successful result, so
``DISPATCH_ERROR_PREFIXES`` is the only thing that can — which makes an
incomplete list a silent hole rather than a cosmetic one.

It was incomplete. The list lived in ``tests/integration/_smoke_args.py`` as a
hand-maintained copy under a "keep this in sync" comment, and six messages the
dispatcher really emits matched nothing in it:

    Review failed:            ← palinode_review is registered strict
    Unknown action:
    Error activating prompt:
    Error listing prompts:
    Error reading file:
    Error reading prompt:

The last four are the instructive ones: ``"Error reading prompt: …"`` does not
start with ``"Error:"``, so the one generic prefix everybody assumes is a
catch-all is not one. ``test_every_tool_dispatches`` therefore scored those
failures as passes.

This module is the guard that keeps the declaration honest. It reads the
literals out of ``palinode/mcp.py`` — the strings *are* the contract, and they
are constructed inline, so there is no runtime registry to enumerate instead.
A regex over source is a weak test when it stands in for behaviour; here it is
the right tool, because what is being checked is precisely whether a declared
list covers what the source emits.

    """Every failure-shaped string literal in the mcp module source.

    Reads **all** string constants, not just those inside a ``_text(...)`` call.
    The first version of this guard scanned `_text(` sites and therefore could
    not see ``_timeout_message()``, which assembles ``"Timeout: …"`` one
    function away and hands it to a caller to wrap — so ``Timeout:`` stayed
    undeclared and a timed-out ``palinode_save`` still read as success. Any
    guard tied to one syntactic form is dodged by moving the string.

    Parsed with ``ast`` rather than ``tokenize``, and that is not a style
    preference — it is the fix for a version split that made this guard behave
    differently on the two Pythons CI runs. Before PEP 701 (3.11) an f-string is
    a single ``STRING`` token; from 3.12 it is ``FSTRING_START`` /
    ``FSTRING_MIDDLE`` / ``FSTRING_END``. A ``tok.type == STRING`` filter
    therefore saw every f-string on 3.11 and none on 3.12 — and nearly every
    real failure message here is an f-string (``f"Save failed: {resp.text}"``),
    so on 3.12 the guard was matching little more than the declaration against
    itself. ``ast`` reports the pieces of a ``JoinedStr`` as ordinary ``Constant``
    nodes on both versions.

    Two exclusions, both by construction rather than by denylist:

    * ``_all_tools()`` — the MCP schema block. Its titles and descriptions are
      *data* the server advertises, not responses it returns, and they open with
      the same words ("Save Memory", "Archive Expired").
    * the ``DISPATCH_ERROR_PREFIXES`` assignment itself — otherwise the scan
      finds the contract and reports that the contract covers it, which is how
      a guard passes while seeing no real emission at all.
