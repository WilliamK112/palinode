"""Scope of the default-db guard: normal suites guarded, ``tests/live/`` exempt.

The autouse ``_no_writes_to_the_default_db`` fixture in ``tests/conftest.py``
fails any test that mutates the database ``config.db_path`` resolved to before
patching — on a developer machine, their real memory store. ``tests/live/`` is
the one suite where writing that database is the point: the harness exports
``PALINODE_DIR`` at a throwaway memory dir and drives a real server against it,
so the resolved default and the fixture are the same directory.

Both halves are invisible from inside a normal run — the guard only speaks when
it fires, and the exemption only speaks when it doesn't — so neither half has a
natural failure mode that a passing suite would surface. Losing the guard shows
up as a developer's database quietly changing; losing the exemption shows up as
every writing live test passing and then erroring in teardown, which is how the
un-scoped version shipped.

Both are asserted here by running a throwaway pytest session over a *copy of the
real conftest*, in a sandbox memory dir, with two identical offender modules:
one at the tests root, one under ``live/``.
